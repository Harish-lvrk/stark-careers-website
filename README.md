Here we used the requirements.txt file 
this is helpful while we deploying into the render platfrom this render platform is used for the diployment of the pthon related projects
- os this requirements.txt which contains the names of the packages needed to install while render platform is deployiing the repo from the git
- here in requiremets it contains gunicorn it does it is a production server for python , as we using flask to run  it shows that it for the development server dont use it for the production.
- so when ever we want ot flask application into production we have to use the gunicorn 
- Render runs this command to build your app before each deploy.
